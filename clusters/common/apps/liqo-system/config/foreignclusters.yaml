# ForeignCluster resources define peers
# Each cluster will apply the ones for OTHER clusters
# These are applied via cluster-specific overlays
#
# Peering topology: Full mesh (all clusters peer with all others)
#
# Ottawa peers with: Robbinsdale, StPetersburg
# Robbinsdale peers with: Ottawa, StPetersburg
# StPetersburg peers with: Ottawa, Robbinsdale
#
# This file is empty - actual ForeignClusters are defined per-cluster
# because each cluster needs different peers
