# Cluster object for Robbinsdale in Push mode
# Applied to Karmada API server (not host cluster)
# The Secret is managed separately in robbinsdale-secret.sops.yaml
#
# NOTE: Uses internal egress service URL (robbinsdale-k8s-operator.tailscale.svc)
# which routes through the common-egress ProxyGroup to reach the external
# Tailscale endpoint (robbinsdale-k8s-operator.keiretsu.ts.net).
# This allows Karmada components to reach the member cluster API server.
